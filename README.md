# Loan Eligibility Prediction Project  

## **Project Description**  
This project predicts loan eligibility based on applicant data. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning, the goal is to create a robust model that accurately classifies applicants as eligible or ineligible for a loan.

## **Key Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and performed feature scaling and encoding.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and relationships between features.  
- **Model Building**: Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.  
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzed feature contributions to model predictions.
