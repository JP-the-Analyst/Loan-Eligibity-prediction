# Loan Eligibility Prediction Project  

## **Project Description**  
This project predicts loan eligibility based on applicant data. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning, the goal is to create a robust model that accurately classifies applicants as eligible or ineligible for a loan.
